# MethodTrackingStackPrintingDebugger
Its a python27 class which you can make other classes inherit from which will print the name of all the instance methods called by that class an its inheritance tree and has the option to also print the call stack of every method and a lot of info from the frame object from the inspect lib including its local variables. Useful for mad inheritance.


Includes some test classes to check out how it works, but they DO NOT include all the possible scenarios you might encounter in mad inheritance scenarios so buyer bewhere. Also im a noob theres probably a bunch of bugs in there.
